Ransomware can be devastating for smaller businesses, as a single infection on a server could wipe critical data or shut down the organization's operations. The challenge usually doesn't lie in the ransom demand itself\u2014in fact, the ransom demand is the least of a small businesses worries. It\u2019s the time and effort required getting systems and servers back online. Some ransomware variants are considered annoyances for organizations with stronger security measures; while they can still cause some damage, they won\u2019t necessarily cripple operations.

Again, resources play a significant role here. An SMB hit with a DDoS attack will find it more difficult to recover compared to larger organizations who have access to better protection. SMBs don\u2019t even have to be targeted themselves to be affected by a DDoS attack. For financial reasons, many SMBs turn to IT hosting rather than hosting their own, placing them at risk of becoming collateral damage for any attack that targets their providers.

While this might be more costly, it can help prevent DDoS attacks from completely overwhelming the organization\u2019s IT services. Another option is to use cloud-based services, which are more scalable when considering DDoS attacks. In addition to not having to maintain network infrastructure for their services on the cloud, SMBs can also take advantage of their service provider\u2019s resources for dealing with DDoS attacks.", "Another method that can help organizations keep websites up and running during a DDoS attack is to have a backup website that mirrors all the data contained in the original website.

The challenge usually doesn't lie in the ransom demand itself\u2014in fact, the ransom demand is the least of a small businesses worries.

Again, resources play a significant role here. An SMB hit with a DDoS attack will find it more difficult to recover compared to larger organizations who have access to better protection. SMBs don\u2019t even have to be targeted themselves to be affected by a DDoS attack. For financial reasons, many SMBs turn to IT hosting rather than hosting their own, placing them at risk of becoming collateral damage for any attack that targets their providers.

EHR software vendors also need to focus on strengthening their data security, as well as perform regular monitoring of vulnerabilities that may affect devices that run their program.", "In our new research paper ", ", we discuss several aspects of the healthcare threat surface. In the first part, we look at how the healthcare sector has evolved as a preferred target for cybercriminals.

However, the two primary indicators that this is a phishing attempt is the identity of the sender - the LinkedIn email contains the website\u2019s domain, whereas the phishing email uses a different domain. The other red flag is the destination of the embedded link. The legitimate email leads to a LinkedIn page, while the phishing email leads to a \u201cphishy\u201d website. Users should take note that they do not need to click on a link to check where it leads since hovering their mouse cursor above the URL will also show the link destination.", "PayPal is the most popular online payment service in the world, with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of payments being processed on a daily basis.

The real Apple warning email has a concise subject line that states exactly what the email is about while the phishing email\u2019s subject line is vague and contains gibberish.

Also noticeable is the misleading domain name that tricks the Apple customer by using a domain that contains the words \u201csupport\u201d. However, it lacks the apple.com domain that the company uses on their emails. Most organizations, especially large ones, have consistent branding across all their URLs and email addresses, so an email that uses a different domain name from the official one is likely to be a phishing attempt.", "This message, purportedly from Apple, was sent to a Trend Micro employee via his work email. At first glance, there seems to be nothing wrong with the warning. However, two signs give away this message as a phishing attempt. First, the employee\u2019s Apple ID is not connected to his work email, which makes it highly improbable for Apple to send the email to this address. Second, it mentions an older iPhone model.

The GDPR is expected to harmonize data protection across all the EU member states as well as bring in a number of key measures that includes mandatory breach disclosure, the right to data portability, and the right to be forgotten.", "The ", " is a new set of rules designed to shape and enhance the privacy of data transfers across the EU states. The European Commission first proposed the regulation to the EU privacy and data protection regime in 2012, before it was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union on April 27, 2016. The order was implemented as a regulation that applies the processing of data of individuals located in the EU. It also applies to organizations, regardless of location, that are involved with activities related to the offer of goods or services to individuals in the EU, or the monitoring of individuals as far as their behavior takes place within the EU.", "Collectively, the set of rules was created to facilitate the free flow of personal data between EU member states within a harmonized framework that upholds and assures privacy and proper management of customer data, regardless of whether the data is in transit or stored.", "The GDPR applies to \u201ccontrollers\u201d, or those who determine how and why personal data is processed, and \u201cprocessors\u201d, who acts on the controller\u2019s behalf. This means that parts of IT that have been unaffected in the past will need attention from businesses to make sure they comply with the new regulation.", "What will it take for SMBs to prepare for the upcoming regulation? Before any business begins its road to compliance, companies need to understand and fully comprehend what the GDPR is, the organizational changes it requires, and what key elements can help determine an organization\u2019s next move.", "While the GDPR will impact both data security and business outcomes for enterprises, it similarly requires SMBs to manage their data flows, transfers, and processes to fully comply with the regulation to the same extent. In this regard, SMBs are expected to measure the risks of their business practices over the privacy of their data subjects, align their interests with the rights of the data subjects, and provide proper documentation that guarantees that these considerations are within their business decision-making process.", "The GDPR applies to each company that processes personal data regardless of the number of its employees. Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMB), or companies with less 250 employees and an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, are allowed some exceptions under the GDPR for the smaller risk that they might pose compared to bigger organizations. To this effect, Data Protection Authorities (DPA) are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of SMBs in the application of the GDPR. For instance, SMBs are relieved of maintaining a record of processed activities, and EU Member States can determine whether SMBs or micro enterprises are required to designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO).", "In order for a business to prepare for the new regulation, they should be able to understand the scope of the fundamental elements provided by the GDPR. While there are a number of stipulations, here are some significant components that could directly impact your business:", "The regulatory landscape of data privacy comes with the extended jurisdiction of the GDPR. Essentially, this means that the GDPR will apply to all companies dealing with the personal data of individuals residing in the EU\u2014regardless of whether the process happens in the EU or not. If your business isn't based in the EU but stores data of EU customers, the GDPR will still require your company to designate in writing a representative in the EU.", "The GDPR will require organizations to quickly report a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful access to, destruction, misuse, of personal data within 72 hours to the relevant supervisory authority. In some cases, a breach should also be disclosed to individuals that are affected, including those who are likely to suffer some form of damage such as identity theft or financial theft.", "In essence, the GDPR is focused on where the business activity occurs, and not on where the business is located, hence, the implication of this affects businesses globally. The GDPR emphasizes that all penalties and fines must be effective, proportionate to the offense, and dissuasive. This means that companies that are outside the EU but doing business with companies or individuals within the EU are subject to sanctions placed by the GDPR.", "The GDPR provides several new rights for individuals to strengthen those that currently exist under the data protection law. Under the GDPR, the enhancement of rights will expand the territorial scope, increase compliance and obligations, and expand regulatory enforcement powers.", "As early as now, organizations are expected to begin the process of complying with the new requirements. While there are a few areas where SMBs are recognized as having fewer resources, they are not exempted from complying. The GDPR urges smaller companies to take a more proactive, risk-based approach to data protection and privacy as most of the rules apply to all organizations regardless of its size. If you are an SMB, you may be pressured by your supply chain to fulfill data controller responsibilities.", "Given these new changes, here\u2019s how you can get a head start on your road to compliance:", " \u2013 in response to the increased territorial scope of the GDPR, your business should set conditions that encompass all pertinent data collection activities. If your business has existing stored data that is or will not be relevant to your current operations, it's recommended that you get rid of it. Having the proper knowledge about your data processing activities can help you come up with a tailored response to the rights of your customers. For example, if you customer wishes to withdraw their personal data or information, consider asking the following questions regarding your data-handling process:", " \u2013 when planning to implement these changes, the biggest challenge involves ensuring compliance, and in line with the requirements, you should seek legal advice to determine if your company should hire a DPO or not. If you fall under the exception of this stipulation, you still need to make sure that your legal team or external council understands data protection in terms of legal and information security.", " \u2013 for sure, the GDPR will result in administrative and compliance costs and not having the proper skills can be a big problem for SMBs. You can scale this challenge by partnering with a data protection expert who knows what it takes to successfully implement the necessary changes while making sure that it's financially viable. This may include an overhaul of your data capture practices, or even acquiring new technologies to ease data transfers and collection.", " \u2013 encryption, firewalls, network security, logging and monitoring of your data and systems are essential areas to pay attention to. These could help you establish a starting point for your data protection practices. In the case of a data breach, this will determine that you have not been negligent.", "Ultimately, the GDPR will present a significant data governance challenge to all affected businesses, but companies that can adapt quickly will be able to avoid reputational risks, and costly fines. Organizations can also expect to reap the benefits of compliance, such as increased trust, certainty of the protection of data transfers and collection, and technological neutrality.", "Trend Micro\u2019s ", " (DLP) protects data in endpoints, network servers, and the cloud, as well as the transfer of data between locations. DLP comes with a central policy management, so there\u2019s no need to install separate technologies across multiple security layers.

Examples of these activities come in many forms and can be found everywhere\u2014from using vulnerabilities in software, websites, and web applications as attack vectors, hosting malicious components in cloud services, to leveraging clickbait posts and links on social networking sites to lure hapless users into falling for their schemes. No matter what technology or service rolls out in the future, there will always be room for abuse.", "During the course of our research on cybercrime, we found that one particular group appears to share the same level of proficiency as cybercriminals in abusing legitimate services: terrorist groups who can be considered as cybercriminals in their own right, as their online activities also run afoul of the law. The two groups have different motives though, as cybercriminals are motivated by financial gain, while terrorists aim to spread propaganda instead of malware.\u00a0", "This research is about how cybercriminals and terrorists overlap in their abuse of technology and online platforms to benefit their cause. We will focus on their methodologies, the services they abuse, and the tools they\u2019ve homebrewed to streamline said abuse so that their followers can facilitate their activities much more easily.", "Due to the obviously illegal nature of their goals, cybercriminals and terrorists share the need to remain untraceable and anonymous online. Both groups are known to abuse tools and services that have been developed to help those who have a legitimate reason to hide their identities (such as journalists, whistleblowers, and activists). Some examples of these tools include anonymizing programs such as TOR, and certain encryption tools found in the Deep Web.", "Another example of a web service we saw being abused by terrorists is the DDoS ", " mitigation service, Cloudflare. A legitimate service designed to provide a working mirror for websites that are either experiencing heavy traffic or being subjected to denial of service attacks, Cloudflare is abused to hide the real hosted IP address of the website. We\u2019ve seen this used time and again by cybercriminals looking to distract or delay authorities from being able to track the location of their hosted servers. We found that terrorists have also begun to adopt Cloudflare to give propaganda websites another level of anonymity.", "Besides this, we\u2019ve also spotted terrorists adopting and distributing \u2018anonymizing\u2019 guides. Originally meant for activists and journalists, these guides are being distributed to their followers, evidently to teach new or uninitiated members ways to avoid being spied on. Some of these guides even mention the National Security Agency and how to avoid surveillance:", "It even goes as far as scolding the reader to deactivate their social media accounts to maintain anonymity. The difference in strategies terrorist groups and common cybercriminals apply to remain anonymous is another example of the contrast between the two parties and their distinct goals.\u00a0 One assumption we can make here is that the consequences of being caught are different for the two groups: cybercriminals only need to worry about jail time, while terrorists would have to contend with counter-terrorism efforts, which may ultimately lead to lengthy prison sentences or death.", "Terrorists and cybercriminals share common communication methods.\u00a0Here are some of the methods that cybercriminals from all over the world use, based on the\u00a0Trend Micro research, ", ":", "We see terrorists utilize these same methods, but for different purposes\u2014their use of the methods above focuses more on communication, coordination and propaganda-sharing (especially with social media) as opposed to price-haggling/cybercrime-related abuse. Secure email services are heavily used by terrorists, with services such as SIGAINT, Ruggedinbox, and Mail2Tor being highly recommended among their ilk.", "Instant messaging is also another method of communication that cybercriminals and terrorists have in common, but used more for communication and coordination rather than for information theft or to spread malicious links. We studied 2,301 accounts that openly support terrorist groups and found that instant messaging service Telegram is the most favored among terrorists, with 34% listing their contact information as a Telegram address. Wickr, Surespot, Signal, and Threema accounted for the rest, along with Whatsapp and other messaging apps. WhatsApp previously saw much more use than the 15% we saw of it today\u2014the reduced use may have stemmed from recent terrorist arrests made through their use of the messaging app.", "Cybercriminals and terrorists also share the use of file hosting and sharing services. These services are mostly used by terrorists to send and spread propaganda and large digital media. Examples of such services used in this fashion include top4top.net, Sendspace, and SecureDrop. Something we must note here is an ongoing trend of terrorist groups preferring file-hosting services based in regions such as the Middle East\u2014presumably another response to the perceived threat of government surveillance plaguing communications platforms in western countries such as the US.", "Finally, we end this section with a note on a communications platform that is unique to terrorist operations\u2014mobile phones. This bears mentioning due to the fact that, unlike cybercriminals whose activities are usually confined to cyberspace, terrorist groups mostly operate in the real world and use digital means to communicate. But instead of this particular means of communication gaining traction, many underground terrorist forums recommend staying off smartphones because of their lack of security. The two most popular mobile platforms (iOS and Android) are considered undesirable in the forums.\u00a0", "One of the clearest differences between cybercriminals and terrorists is their desire to spread propaganda. While cybercriminals\u2019 main goals are to commit cybercrime and stay hidden while they do it, terrorists aim to have their content go viral.\u00a0While cybercriminals\u2019 main goals are to commit cybercrime (the unlawful electronic theft of funds) and stay hidden while they do it, terrorists aim to have their content go viral, to be seen and consumed not only by their followers but also by a wider public audience.\u00a0At the same time, terrorist groups also try their best not to be banned or censored from the channels they use to spread their propaganda, or to have their real-life identities traced and detected while doing it.", "How do they broadcast their propaganda?", "From establishing the similarities and differences in the technologies and communication methods that cybercriminals and terrorists have, we now move onto the technologies that are specific to the latter group. We have uncovered certain applications that have been homebrewed by terrorist groups to aid members who aren't as technically proficient into preserving their anonymities and securing their lines of communication. These are the six most popular and commonly-used ones, based on our observations online.", "In being able to gain a level of visibility on the online activities of both terrorists and cybercriminals, we see a lot of differences and similarities in their techniques and methods. While both groups are particularly keen on keeping their anonymity online, the way they disseminate information related to their agenda is quite different. We see that cybercriminals are more inclined to engage with limited contacts, and put weight on individuals\u2019 online reputation. Terrorist organizations, on the other hand, focus their efforts on getting their propaganda out to a wider audience, in the hopes of finding potential sympathizers.", "Motivations aside, there are a lot of overlaps regarding the online presence of terrorist organizations and cybercriminals. They both communicate through the same channels and use the same technologies, making the task of tracking terrorists as challenging as it is to track cybercriminals, if not more. Knowing the channels and technologies they use, however, is a critical first step towards getting a better understanding of how these groups function, which can ultimately help provide ways to stop their activities."]},

Targeting vulnerabilities in servers to spread ransomware is a new dimension to an already prolific threat\u201d, said Cisco ", ". According to the IR Services Team, Talos began investigating more on the SAMSAM ransomware due to recent customer feedback. A closer look into the JBoss vectors led them to the discovery of approximately 3.2 million servers at risk of infection due to poor patching practices.", "The JBoss vulnerability that SAMSAM used was patched many years ago, however, due to older, unpatched applications, several systems\u2014including Follet\u2019s Learning Destiny Library software\u2014was hit. More findings led to the detection of 2,100 installed backdoors across 1,600 IP addresses. The Follet\u2019s Destiny software is a large Library Management system designed to track school library assets and is used in K-12 schools in the US and across the globe. Cisco stated that Follet had an impressive response. \u201cBased on our internal systems security monitoring protocol, Follet identified the issue and immediately took actions to address and close the vulnerability on behalf of our customers. Follet takes data security very seriously and as a result, we are continuously monitoring our systems and software for threats, and enhancing our technology environment with the goal of minimizing risks for the institutions we serve\u201d, Follet stated.", "Follet also captured any non-Destiny files that were present on the system to help remove any existing backdoors on the systems. Additionally, Follet\u2019s technical support will also provide security measures to customers who may have suspicious files on their systems. Given the extent of the threat, Follet strongly extends support to ensure that their customers take advantage of the patch.", "Ransomware has gone a long way from just issuing empty threats\u2014with its ability to hijack files and render systems useless and the use of extortion methods as a means of scaring victims to pay up. Last month, SAMSAM, via JBoss as well, targeted the healthcare industry by exploiting system vulnerabilities to gain remote shell access. Interestingly, SAMSAM was notable due to its ability to spread via unpatched servers, unlike traditional ransomware which relies on social engineering techniques or malvertising. This time around, attackers found another sector to target\u2014schools. Schools make for an ideal target not only because of the information they store, but because schools are more likely to have outdated IT security systems due to years of underfunding."]},

Previous incidents and trends related to DDoS attacks between 2013 and 2015 revealed that average peak bandwidth had doubled. Towards the end of 2014, after the Occupy Central protests in Hong Kong, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince stated that the largest DDoS attack was done against independent media sites in the province.

Let\u2019s say a user walks in to a bank that only has one teller window open. As soon as the user approaches the teller, another person cuts in front the user and begins making small talk with the teller, with no real intention of making any bank-related transactions.

Evidently, there has been an increase of computer intrusions linked to BEC scams, involving fraudsters impersonating high level executives, sending phishing emails from seemingly legitimate sources, and requesting wire transfers to alternate, fraudulent accounts. These methods ultimately lead to successful intrusion and unfettered access to their victims\u2019 credentials.", "The FBI defines Business Email Compromise (BEC) as a sophisticated scam targeting businesses working with foreign suppliers and businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments. Formerly known as Man-in-the-Email scams, these schemes compromise official business email accounts to conduct unauthorized fund transfers. According to the FBI, victims lost nearly $750 million dollars and affected more than 7,000 people between October 2013 and August 2015. Globally, cybercriminals scammed more than $50 million dollars from victims in non-US countries.\u00a0", "BEC scams often begin with an attacker compromising a business executive\u2019s email account or any publicly listed email. This is usually done using keylogger malware or phishing methods, where attackers create a domain that\u2019s similar to the company they\u2019re targeting, or a spoofed email that tricks the target into providing account details. Upon monitoring the compromised email account, the fraudster will try to determine who initiates wires and who requests them. The perpetrators often perform a fair amount of research, looking for a company that has had a change in leadership in the C-suite of the finance function, companies where executives are traveling, or by leading an investor conference call.

This contact, typically made via phone or e-mail, pressures the contacted party into acting quickly or secretly in handling the transfer of funds. This type of BEC scheme may be timed to occur at the end of the business day or work week, when employees are getting ready to rest and thus vulnerable to panic.", "This scheme involves the email of role-specific employees (usually human resources) in the company being compromised and then used to send requests \u2013 not for fund transfers but for personally-identifiable information of other employees and executives. This can therefore serve as a jump-off point for more damaging BEC attacks against the company itself.", "The scam mostly banks on social engineering, and typically doesn\u2019t need sophisticated system penetration. Unlike phishing scams, the emails used in BEC scams are not mass-emailed to avoid being flagged as spam. In addition, in BEC scams, the victims are tricked into doing the transfers for them, usually instructing the victims to act quickly or in confidence when transferring funds.", "In 2014, findings revealed that cybercriminals go beyond common attack methods to steal information.
