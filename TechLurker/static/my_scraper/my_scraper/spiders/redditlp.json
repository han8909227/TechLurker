First, you said you had months of debating so I'm assuming getting into programming is what you want to do as your future career and you're willing to go all in on it.

Talk to family members and see if there's anything they can do to help. Please don't take a loan out of a bank because remember this, the coding bootcamp does NOT guarantee you a job right after graduating.

So in an MVC framework, the user visits a URL, that URL has a route assigned to it in the code....the route points to a method in a controller. The controller is triggered and the controller can leverage a model to get data out of the database and then render a view with that data. The user can then take some action on that webpage/view, like click a button and the process repeats. An example would be a person is visiting the homepage of a website and they click on a button that says, \"Show All Users\". That button is a link to /users. By going to /users, a route is found which matches /users and calls the index method in the users controller. The index method calls the all method on the User model (ie users = User.all()). The all method on the User model, knows to fetch all records from the Users table and we can save those records in a variable called users. Then the last line in the controller method might be something like, render('users_view', users) which indicates the users_view file should be called to render on the webpage and the users variable is passed to that view. The users_view then probably has a php loop in the html which iterates over the users and can display a link which has a user's first name, last name and date of birth.

Because of this I have noticed that some of my code, while functional and passes the test cases in challenges, doesn't seem very efficient.
