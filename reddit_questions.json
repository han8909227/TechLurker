I'm not saying it can't be done under 4 years but for sure not as quick as 3 months. Bootcamps at most teach you how to use a framework, but these frameworks have great free resources and documentation. If you already have a CS or STEM degree and quickly need to pick up web development then sure, but if you have no or non-related degree then I don't see the point cause you'll have to learn fundamental CS anyways.

A lot of coding concepts are tough for people to learn and understand in practice until they use it over and over--like closures and lexical scoping.  They are fairly easy to understand conceptually, but not always in practice until you've worked with them over and over again.

You definitely can learn this material on your own, (shout out to the Odin Project!), although I would say that no other free online resource I have found does as good a job explaining concepts as Learn.co. The one caveat I have with the curriculum is that it focuses on Ruby for the backend, which is really not a popular language anymore. If you want to work as a backend engineer, be prepared to learn another popular language and associated backend framework on your own time. On the plus side, the frontend section is focused on React and Redux, which are in demand frameworks at the moment.", "I really like the flexibility that learning online has given me. If I get something, I can power through the section. If I need more help, I can watch a live lecture, get help with a technical coach, or spend more time reading up on a concept or tinkering with code. I feel as though this makes the learning process much less stressful than going to an in person bootcamp that is set to a rigid course. The online community is decent, but it is no substitute for a face to face conversation. In my opinion, this is one of the worst drawbacks of taking an online course. Networking is much more difficult. I have made one friend, and several acquaintances through their Slack channel. All that being said, if you make an effort to use the online community it is great. Everyone in the program is very friendly and supportive. Live lectures are constantly firing.

So in an MVC framework, the user visits a URL, that URL has a route assigned to it in the code....the route points to a method in a controller. The controller is triggered and the controller can leverage a model to get data out of the database and then render a view with that data. The user can then take some action on that webpage/view, like click a button and the process repeats. An example would be a person is visiting the homepage of a website and they click on a button that says, \"Show All Users\". That button is a link to /users. By going to /users, a route is found which matches /users and calls the index method in the users controller. The index method calls the all method on the User model (ie users = User.all()). The all method on the User model, knows to fetch all records from the Users table and we can save those records in a variable called users. Then the last line in the controller method might be something like, render('users_view', users) which indicates the users_view file should be called to render on the webpage and the users variable is passed to that view. The users_view then probably has a php loop in the html which iterates over the users and can display a link which has a user's first name, last name and date of birth.

Once I show them where the problem is they usually can figure out how to solve it either on their own or through google. Especially when you're still new to it and even more prone towards making mistakes, having a strong troubleshooting skill set is key.

I learned it in my other life as a theatre technician but a simplified way I heard it explained once was if you have a sound cable that isn't working, cut it in half and test each end, the half that is working doesn't contain your problem and can be ignored for now. The half that doesn't work, cut in half again. Rinse and repeat until you have your section of cable that doesn't work and fix the problem. Isolating the problem is a process of elimination. Error codes can be super helpful in this if they're around but they aren't always and sometimes they can be red herrings pointing you to just a symptom and not the cause. Start at where the problem is occurring and work your way backwards, eliminating possible issues as you go. This is easier if it's code you're familiar with as you aren't hunting for what connects to what as well as hunting for what isn't working, but follow the path backwards. Debuggers, breakpoints, and tools that let you step through code line by line are also useful here but even without those you can add in try/catch blocks or die('I reached point A'); kind of statements. And as you are learning, remember the steps and the tools and what was helpful in what situations, and what wasn't, and reapply in the future. I see so many beginners not pay attention, or even try to retain, how to solve problems because I think they feel if they just get good enough at coding they'll never have to deal with bugs, which is just ridiculous.

However, we need to have the ability to compare the resulting spend in the model (using the volume from our forecast times the rate we pay for equipment) to the numbers budgeted for our organization previously. The previous budget numbers don't come from a database query, its a very manual lookup process right now that involves looking through a web database of previous equipment approvals and summarizing results in excel.", "The third type of inputs are other misc. cost inputs that usually come in the form of emailed guidance from cost owners (such as taxes, freight, employee costs, networking costs, etc.). Some of these costs can be shared across factories and some can be dedicated to a single site / piece of equipment.", "Lastly are modeling assumptions, such as the step-wise scaling factors that influence when we scale a factory to a large design (ideally pulled from another database, but it's not that simple currently). Other modeling assumptions include the type of factory design, which tells us what specific equipment we need to buy and in what quantity. There are a number of different designs and generations of equipment available. These factory designs are not currently in a machine readable format, we are working on getting them in this format soon.", " Our execs like to review things in document form, which means we need outputs that can be easily converted into a table or graphical format. The outputs ideally simply present aggregate costs at the cluster level in P&L form, but also give us the ability to easily dig into specific sites and show the impact of specific cost drivers (e.g. real estate costs are really high in this one market, which is why total costs look high). Ideally, we'd have the ability to compare results for a specific region easily with results from other specific regions through some sort of database connectivity. In other words, benchmarking the model's outputs against other regions' outputs is really important and this is why automating this model with something more than VBA appeals to me. Having all this information, with the ability to easily and quickly drill down to specific cost drivers and compare them across regions would be amazing.", "As you can see from the above, this is really a question to folks who have experience building large scale applications like this and who can tell me whether this is even doable.
