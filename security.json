Ransomware can be devastating for smaller businesses, as a single infection on a server could wipe critical data or shut down the organization's operations. The challenge usually doesn't lie in the ransom demand itself\u2014in fact, the ransom demand is the least of a small businesses worries. It\u2019s the time and effort required getting systems and servers back online. Some ransomware variants are considered annoyances for organizations with stronger security measures; while they can still cause some damage, they won\u2019t necessarily cripple operations.

Again, resources play a significant role here. An SMB hit with a DDoS attack will find it more difficult to recover compared to larger organizations who have access to better protection. SMBs don\u2019t even have to be targeted themselves to be affected by a DDoS attack. For financial reasons, many SMBs turn to IT hosting rather than hosting their own, placing them at risk of becoming collateral damage for any attack that targets their providers.

One of the ways SMBs can prevent or at least minimize DDoS attacks is by overprovisioning bandwidth. While this might be more costly, it can help prevent DDoS attacks from completely overwhelming the organization\u2019s IT services. Another option is to use cloud-based services, which are more scalable when considering DDoS attacks. In addition to not having to maintain network infrastructure for their services on the cloud, SMBs can also take advantage of their service provider\u2019s resources for dealing with DDoS attacks.", "Another method that can help organizations keep websites up and running during a DDoS attack is to have a backup website that mirrors all the data contained in the original website.
